- Introduction:
This document provides documentation for the widget testing of the 'BottomNavigationBarScreen' widget in the Palmear application. The test verifies the correct color of the selected tab in the bottom navigation bar.

- Test Description:
The test checks whether the selected tab in the bottom navigation bar has the correct color.

- Code Description:
The test is written in Dart using the Flutter framework's testing library, flutter_test. It verifies the color of the selected tab in the bottom navigation bar.

- Test Function
The test function is named 'testWidgets' and is wrapped within the 'main' function. It checks the selected tab's color in the bottom navigation bar.

- Test Assertions:
1 - Ensure that the bottom navigation bar widget is found.
2 - Verify that the selected tab's background color matches the expected color.

- Execution:
1. Run the Dart test file containing the provided test code.

    - Which could be done through the following command line in the terminal:
        flutter test test\bottom_navigation_bar_testing\bottom_navigation_bar_widget_testing.dart
    - Or if you wish to test all testing files under the 'test' folder you do that through the following command line in the terminal:
        flutter test 
            or
        flutter test test/

2. Observe the test output for pass status in green or fail status in red.

- Expected Result:
The test should pass, indicating that the selected tab in the bottom navigation bar has the correct color (expected color: #00916E).

- Error Handling:
If the test fails, review recent code changes that could affect the bottom navigation bar's appearance. Ensure that the correct color is applied to the selected tab.

- Conclusion:
This documentation outlines the structure and purpose of the widget testing code for the 'BottomNavigationBarScreen' widget in the Palmear application. Future enhancements may include additional test cases for improved testing coverage.
