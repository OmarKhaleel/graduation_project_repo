- Introduction:
  This document provides an overview of the unit testing process for the login authentication feature of the Palmear application. Unit testing ensures that each individual component of the code performs as expected, helping to identify and fix any issues early in the development process.

- Purpose:
  The purpose of the login authentication unit testing is to verify the behavior of the login screen under various scenarios, including valid and invalid credentials, as well as empty email and password fields.

- Test Cases, the following test cases are covered in the unit testing:
  1- Valid Credential Test Case: Verifies that authentication is successful with valid credentials.
  2- Invalid Credential Test Case: Verifies that authentication fails with invalid credentials.
  3- Empty Email/Password Fields Test Case: Verifies that authentication fails when email and password are empty.

- Conclusion:
  Unit testing ensures the login authentication feature of the Palmear application functions reliably. By covering various scenarios, such as valid and invalid credentials, and empty fields, we enhance the quality and user experience of the application.
